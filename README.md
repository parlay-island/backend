# Parlay Island Backend

The Parlay Island backend provides a web API to access and manipulate question
and student data.

Written in Django.

## Running the server

To run the server, use the following command: `python3 manage.py runserver`.

## Using the Postman collection

The Postman collection in the repo offers two benefits:
- Server mocking
- API testing

### Server mocking

Currently, the collection in this repository is being mocked at the following
URL: `https://80066165-a2ae-4dcd-9ffa-f7a164492c69.mock.pstmn.io`. As endpoints
are added to the mock API, these endpoints will be accessible at this URL.

Later in the project, the Postman collection will be used to test the API as a
part of the project's CI.
